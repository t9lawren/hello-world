My First Repository

Hello World! My name is Timoteo (in Spanish)! I enjoy many things related to geek culture like gaming, scifi/fantasy movies, graphic novels, etc. When I'm not stuffing my face with tasty food, playing with my family, attending Harvest Church or going for a run I earn a living as a Software Developer.
